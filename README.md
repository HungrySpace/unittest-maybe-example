Hi. I am writing tests in `python` using `unittest'. But there is a problem. Before running the tests, it is necessary to perform a migration for the database. Therefore, I created the file `__main__` and described in it how the tests will be run. Now we have to run tests with the `python 3 test` command. I am required to run tests `python -m unit test discover test -t .`
